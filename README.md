## Infrastructure 

This is my submission for the SRE challenge, which entails making and testing a web server with specific constraints.
To deploy, simply navigate to the folder and run the "deploy-script" script. You can test it with "test-script", and the results should look like the image below

I chose to use python3.
To run the program, start it using python 3, then enter the amount of codes you will supply. After that, enter each code, seperated by a new line. You can use the same smaple input from the website as well.
